## eGovernments Foundation
[eGovernments Foundation](http://www.egovernments.org/) transforms urban governance with the use of scalable and replicable technology solutions that enable efficient and effective municipal operations, better decision making, and contact-less urban service delivery. Their mission is to bring better and inclusive governance, leading to smarter cities.
eGovernments Foundation is looking forward to moving the governmental operations from a reactive mode to a proactive mode by using the historical complaint data;  predicting the complaints and the locations so that the government can effectively utilize its resources. 

This project will be using the data from the eGovernments implementation for the Chennai Municipal Corporation. It will involve building a system to forecast the number of complaints in a ward on a monthly level, based on which the Corporation can plan for resources ahead and increase overall preparedness. In addition to this, an alerts system to keep the stakeholders notified of events of interest will also be looked at. It is envisaged that such developments will help in driving proactive action.
